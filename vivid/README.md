MVP: 
Minimum Goals - Create 6 components, place proper routes, and utilize Storybook to create 5 reuseable components. Need to have features: the ability for people to select the button if they like the task or do not like the take. The option for someone to have a funny joke told to them if they do not wish to complete the task. 

Post-MVP: 
Nice to have features - A graph or some type of fun feature showing how many people actually completed the tasks given to them so it can encourage others to complete the task. 

SWOT Analysis:
I will overcome my weakness by starting on those areas first to minimize any errors later in the week.
